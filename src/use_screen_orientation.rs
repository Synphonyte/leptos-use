/// ## Demo
///
/// [Link to Demo](https://github.com/Synphonyte/leptos-use/tree/main/examples/use_screen_orientation)
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```
/// # use leptos::prelude::*;
/// # use leptos_use::{use_screen_orientation, UseScreenOrientationReturn};
/// #
/// # #[component]
/// # fn Demo() -> impl IntoView {
/// let UseScreenOrientationReturn { orientation, angle, lock_orientation, unlock_orientation } = use_screen_orientation();
/// #
/// # view! { }
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## Server-Side Rendering
///
/// > Make sure you follow the [instructions in Server-Side Rendering](https://leptos-use.rs/server_side_rendering.html).
///
/// On the server `orientation` will always be `ScreenOrientation::PortraitPrimary` and `angle` will always be `0`.
/// The locking functions will be no-ops.
