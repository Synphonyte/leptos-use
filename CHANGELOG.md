# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] - 

### New Functions 🚀

- `use_prefers_reduced_motion`

## [0.12.0] - 2024-08-14

> Make sure you also update `cargo-leptos` to the latest version if you use that.

### Breaking Changes 🛠

- Updated to web_sys 0.3.70 which unfortunately is breaking some things.
- `use_clipboard` doesn't need the unstable flags anymore.
- `use_locale` now uses `unic_langid::LanguageIdentifier` and proper locale matching (thanks to @mondeja).
- Removed `UseMouseEventExtractorDefault` and reworked `UseMouseCoordType` (thanks to @carloskiki)
- `use_preferred_dark` and `use_color_mode` now try to read the `Sec-CH-Prefers-Color-Scheme` header in SSR. This brings
  the necessity to enable an additional feature for them (`axum` / `actix` / `spin`).

### Fixes 🍕

- Fixed the codec chapter in the book to refer to crate `codee`.

## [0.11.4] - 2024-08-12

### New Features 🚀

- `use_web_notification` now supports the options `renotify`, `silent` and `image` (thanks to @hcandelaria).
- `sync_signal` no supports the options `assign_ltr` and `assign_rtl`.

## [0.11.3] - 2024-07-31

### Fix 🍕

- Made `use_timeout_fn` SSR-safe

## [0.11.2] - 2024-07-30

### Change 🔥

## (yanked) [0.11.1] - 2024-07-28 

### New Functions 🚀

- `use_locale` (thanks to @BrandonDyer64)
- `use_locales` (thanks to @BrandonDyer64)
- `header` – Standard implementations for reading a header on the server.

## [0.11.0] - 2024-07-27

### Breaking Changes 🛠

- Updated to Leptos 0.7

## [Unreleased]

### New Functions 🚀

- `use_user_media`

### New Features 🚀

- Codecs:
    - All codecs now live in their own crate `codee`
    - There are now binary codecs in addition to string codecs.
        - `FromToBytesCodec`
        - `WebpackSerdeCodec`
        - `BincodeSerdeCodec`
        - `ProstCodec` (see also the section "Breaking Changes 🛠" below)
    - Every binary codec can be used as a string codec with the `Base64` wrapper which encodes the binary data as a
      base64
      string.
        - This required feature `base64`
        - It can be wrapped for example like this: `Base64<WebpackSerdeCodec>`.
    - There is now an `OptionCodec` wrapper that allows to wrap any string codec that encodes `T` to encode `Option<T>`.
        - Use it like this: `OptionCodec<FromToStringCodec<f64>>`.

- `ElementMaybeSignal` is now implemented for `websys::HtmlElement` (thanks to @blorbb).
- `UseStorageOptions` now has `delay_during_hydration` which has to be used when you conditionally show parts of
  the DOM controlled by a value from storage. This leads to hydration errors which can be fixed by setting this new
  option to `true`.
- `cookie::SameSite` is now re-exported
- Changing the signal returned by `use_cookie` now tries and changes the headers during SSR.
- New book chapter about codecs
- The macro `use_derive_signal!` is now exported (thanks to @mscofield0).

### Breaking Changes 🛠

- `UseStorageOptions` and `UseEventSourceOptions` no longer accept a `codec` value because this is already provided as a
  generic parameter to the respective function calls.
- Codecs have been refactored. There are now two traits that codecs implement: `Encoder` and `Decoder`. The
  trait `StringCodec` is gone. The methods are now associated methods and their params now always take references.
    - `JsonCodec` has been renamed to `JsonSerdeCodec`.
    - The feature to enable this codec is now called `json_serde` instead of just `serde`.
    - `ProstCodec` now encodes as binary data. If you want to keep using it with string data you can wrap it like
      this: `Base64<ProstCodec>`.
    - All of these structs, traits and features now live in their own crate called `codee`
    - A bunch of new codecs are available. Have a look at the docs for crate `codee`.
- `use_websocket`:
    - `UseWebsocketOptions` has been renamed to `UseWebSocketOptions` (uppercase S) to be consistent with the return
      type.
    - `UseWebSocketOptions::reconnect_limit` and `UseEventSourceOptions::reconnect_limit` is now `ReconnectLimit`
      instead
      of `u64`. Use `ReconnectLimit::Infinite` for infinite retries or `ReconnectLimit::Limited(...)` for limited
      retries.
    - `use_websocket` now uses codecs to send typed messages over the network.
        - When calling you have give type parameters for the message type and the
          codec: `use_websocket::<String, WebpackSerdeCodec>`
        - You can use binary or string codecs.
        - The `UseWebSocketReturn::send` closure now takes a `&T` which is encoded using the codec.
        - The `UseWebSocketReturn::message` signal now returns an `Option<T>` which is decoded using the codec.
        - `UseWebSocketReturn::send_bytes` and `UseWebSocketReturn::message_bytes` are gone.
        - `UseWebSocketOptions::on_message` and `UseWebSocketOptions::on_message_bytes` have been renamed
          to `on_message_raw` and `on_message_raw_bytes`.
        - The new `UseWebSocketOptions::on_message` takes a `&T`.
        - `UseWebSocketOptions::on_error` now takes a `UseWebSocketError` instead of a `web_sys::Event`.
- `use_storage` now always saves the default value to storage if the key doesn't exist yet.
- Renamed `BreakpointsSematic` to `BreakpointsSemantic` and `breakpoints_sematic` to `breakpoints_semantic`
  (note the `n`) (thanks to @mondeja).

### Fixes 🍕

- Fixed auto-reconnect in `use_websocket`
- Fixed typo in compiler error messages in `use_cookie` (thanks to @SleeplessOne1917).
- Fixed potential signal out of scope issue with `use_raf_fn`

### Breaking Changes 🛠

- The `leptos` version is now 0.6
- The trait `Codec` has been renamed to `StringCodec` and has been moved to `util::StringCodec`.
    - The struct `StringCodec` has been renamed to `FromToStringCodec` and has been moved to `util::FromToStringCodec`.
    - The structs `JsonCodec` and `ProstCodec` have been moved to `util` as well.
- The function `use_storage` now requires type parameters for the stored type and the codec like all the other
  `...storage...` functions.

### Fixes 🍕

- Fixed `use_geolocation` SSR compile issue
- Fixed `use_intl_number_format` maximum fraction digits option

### Changes 🔥

- The `UseMouseReturn` signals `x`, `y`, and `source_type` are now of type `Signal<f64>` instead of `ReadSignal<f64>`.
- You can now convert `leptos::html::HtmlElement<T>` into `Element(s)MaybeSignal`. This should make functions a lot
  easier to use in directives.

- Throttled or debounced callbacks (in watch\__ or _\_fn) no longer are called after the containing scope was cleaned
  up.

## [0.9.0] - 2023-12-06

### New Functions 🚀

- `use_display_media` (thanks to @seanaye)

### Breaking Changes 🛠

- (@feral-dot-io) The use `use_<type>_storage` functions have been rewritten to use `Codec`s instead of always
  requiring `serde`.
    - This also removes the feature `storage`
    - By default the `StringCodec` is used which relies on types implementing `FromString + ToString`
    - If you want to use `JsonCodec` you have to enable the feature `serde`
    - If you want to use `ProstCodec` (new!) you have to enable the feature `prost`.
- (@feral-dot-io) The Rust flag `--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis` is not needed anymore since relevant `web_sys` APIs are
  now stable.
  This affects in particular
    - `use_element_size`
    - `use_resize_observer`

### Fixes 🍕

- `use_raf_fn` and `use_timestamp` no longer spam warnings because of `get`ting signals outside of reactive contexts.
- `use_infinite_scroll` no longer calls the callback twice for the same event
- `use_scroll` now uses `try_get_untracked` in the debounced callback to avoid panics if the context has been destroyed
  while the callback was waiting to be called.
- `use_idle` works properly now (no more idles too early).
- `use_web_notification` doesn't panic on the server anymore.

## [0.8.2] - 2023-11-09

    - use_timestamp
    - use_raf_fn
    - use_idle

## [0.8.1] - 2023-10-28

  a `web_sys::AddEventListenerOptions`.
- `use_mutation_observer_with_options` now takes a `UseMutationObserverOptions` instead of
  a `web_sys::MutationObserverInit`.

    - takes now a `&str` instead of a `String` as its `url` parameter.
    - same for the returned `send` method.
    - The `ready_state` return type is now renamed to `ConnectionReadyState` instead of `UseWebSocketReadyState`.

      `Signal<...>` instead of `ReadSignal<...>` to make them more consistent with other functions.
    - The options `reconnect_limit` and `reconnect_interval` now take a `u64` instead of `Option<u64>` to improve DX.
    - The option `manual` has been renamed to `immediate` to make it more consistent with other functions.
      To port please note that `immediate` is the inverse of `manual` (`immediate` = `!manual`).
